        the vectordb_tool to decide what types of assets and their respective allocations
        the user should incorporate into their portfolio. For each asset class that you decided 
        to include in the user's investment portfolio, use the web_search_tool to search any 
        news or information related to the respective assets. 
    
        Example Output: 
        **Overall Asset Allocation :
        * Bond ETFs: 20%
        * Common Stock: 80%
        * ... and so on for all asset classes
        - explanation: Bond ETFs is generally suited for people with your 
            investment style. According to recent news, common stock has been on the rise 
            while bond etfs have been on the decline so you may need to adjust the 
            allocation percentages accordingly depending on your risk tolerance.

    **Detailed Asset Class Breakdowns => using Vector Store**
    * Query the vector store to find information on relevant subcategories and investment options specific to that asset class
  and user's specific investment goals, investment horizon, and risk_tolerance. 
  * Analyze the retrieved data using historical performance, risk profiles, etc  based on the asset class type.
  * Based on this analysis and user input, recommend specific allocations for subcategories within the asset class. 
  * Explain the rationale behind the allocation percentages for each subcategory.""")

# 6 types of investments

## 1. Stocks

### Definition of a stock 
A stock is a security that represents a fractional ownership in a company. When you buy a company's stock, you're purchasing a small piece of that company, called a share.

Investors purchase stocks in companies they think will go up in value. If that happens, the company's stock increases in value as well. The stock can then be sold for a profit.

When you own stock in a company, you are called a shareholder because you share in the company's profits.

Public companies sell their stock through a stock market exchange, like the Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange. (Here's more about the basics of the stock market.) For companies, issuing stock can be a way to raise money to pay off debt, launch new products, or expand their operations, according to the SEC.

For investors, investing in stocks is a way to grow your money and outpace inflation over time. When you're a shareholder, you can make money when stock prices rise, you may earn dividends when the company distributes earnings, and some shareholders can vote at shareholder meetings.

Investors can buy and sell shares through stockbrokers. The stock exchanges track the supply and demand of each company's stock, which directly affects the stock's price.

Stock prices fluctuate throughout the day, but investors who own stock hope that over time, the stock will increase in value. Not every company or stock does so, however: Companies can lose value or go out of business completely. When that happens, stock investors may lose all or part of their investment. That's why it's important for investors to diversify. A good rule of thumb is to spread money around, buying stock in many different companies rather than focusing on just one.

Stocks carry more risk than some other investments, but also have the potential to reap higher rewards. Stock investors earn money in two main ways:

If the price of a stock goes up during the time you own it, and you sell it for more than you paid for it.

Through dividends. Dividends are regular payments to shareholders. Not all stocks pay dividends, but those that do typically do so on a quarterly basis.


Over the last century, the stock market has posted an average annual return of 10%. The word average is important here: Not only is that return an average for the market as a whole — rather than a specific individual stock — but in any given year, the market's return can be lower or higher than 10%.

You can buy individual stocks through an online broker. The process of opening a brokerage account is similar to opening a bank account. The commissions charged by online brokers for stock trades vary, so it's important to shop around.

### Key things to know about stocks
#### Common stocks vs. preferred stocks
There are two main types of stocks: common and preferred. The main differences between common stock and preferred stock are dividends and voting rights. Most investors own common stock in a public company. Common stock may pay dividends, but dividends are not guaranteed, and the amount of the dividend is not fixed. Investors of common stock typically have voting rights that are proportional to their ownership level.

Preferred stocks typically pay fixed dividends, so owners can count on a set amount of income from the stock each year. Owners of preferred stock also stand at the front of the line when it comes to the company’s earnings: Excess cash distributed by dividend is paid to preferred shareholders first, and if the company goes bankrupt, preferred stock owners receive any liquidation of assets before common stock owners. Owners of preferred stock usually do not have voting rights.

## 2. Bonds
A bond is a loan to a company or government that pays investors a fixed rate of return. The borrower uses the money to fund its operations, and the investor receives interest on the investment.

Bonds are a key ingredient in a balanced portfolio and one of the three main asset classes, or groups of investments, frequently used in investing. A bond's risk is based mainly on the issuer's creditworthiness (that is, how likely they are to repay their debts). Interest rates also influence a bond's value.

The market value of a bond can change over time. Long term government bonds historically earn an average of around 5% annual returns, compared to the average stock market return of 10%.

Most investment portfolios should include some bonds, whose relative safety helps balance out risks associated with stock based investments. If stock markets plummet, bonds can help cushion the blow.

### Types of bonds
Bonds, like many investments, balance risk and reward. Typically, bonds that are lower risk pay lower interest rates. Bonds that are riskier pay higher rates in exchange for the investor giving up some safety. 

#### U.S. Treasurys
U.S. Treasurys are considered among the safest investments because they’re issued with the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, which has always paid back its debts. However, they tend to pay lower interest rates than other investments. Treasury bills, Treasury notes, Treasury bonds and Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) differ in their time to maturity and interest rates.

#### Corporate bonds
Companies can issue corporate bonds when they need to raise money. For example, if a company wants to build a new plant, it may issue bonds and pay investors a stated interest rate until the bond matures. The company also repays the original principal. But unlike buying stock in a company, purchasing a corporate bond doesn’t confer a share of ownership.

Corporate bonds can be either high yield or investment grade. High yield means they have a lower credit rating and offer higher interest rates in exchange for a higher risk of default. Investment grade means they have a higher credit rating and pay lower interest rates due to a lower risk of default.

#### Municipal bonds
Municipal bonds, also called munis, are issued by states, cities, counties and other non federal government entities. Similar to how corporate bonds fund company projects or ventures, municipal bonds fund state or city projects, like building schools or highways.

Municipal bonds can have tax benefits. Bondholders may not have to pay federal taxes on the interest, which can translate to a lower interest rate from the issuer. Munis may also be exempt from state and local taxes if issued in your state or city.

Municipal bonds can vary in term: Short term bonds repay their principal in one to three years, while long term bonds can take over ten years to mature.

## 3. Mutual funds
Mutual funds are baskets of stocks, bonds or other investments that you can buy into. They're the bedrock of many investment accounts, especially retirement accounts like 401(k)s. Investing in mutual funds is popular in part because they're a relatively handsoff way to invest in many different assets at once — within a single mutual fund, you could gain exposure to hundreds of stocks, bonds or other investments. 

### Understand mutual fund fees
Whether you choose active or passive funds, a company will charge an annual fee for fund management and other costs of running the fund, expressed as a percentage of the cash you invest and known as the expense ratio. For example, a fund with a 1% expense ratio will cost you $10 for every $1,000 you invest.

A fund’s expense ratio isn’t always easy to identify upfront (you may have to dig through a fund’s prospectus to find it), but it's well worth the effort to understand, because these fees can eat into your returns over time.

Mutual funds come in different structures that can impact costs:

Open end funds: Most mutual funds are this variety, where there is no limit to the number of investors or shares. The NAV per share rises and falls with the value of the fund.

Closed end funds: These funds have a limited number of shares offered during an initial public offering, much as a company would. There are far fewer closed end funds on the market compared with open end funds. A closed end fund’s trading price is quoted throughout the day on a stock exchange. That price may be higher or lower than the fund’s actual value.

Whether or not funds carry commissions is expressed by “loads,” such as:

Load funds: Mutual funds that pay a sales charge or commission to the broker or salesperson who sold the fund, which is typically passed on to the investor.

No load funds: Also known as no transaction fee funds, these mutual funds charge no sales commissions for the purchase or sale of a fund share. This is the best deal for investors, and online brokers often have thousands of choices for no transaction fee mutual funds. Most funds available to individual investors are currently no load.

### Manage your mutual fund portfolio
1. Stock mutual funds = higher potential returns (or losses)
Stock mutual funds, also known as equity mutual funds, carry the highest potential rewards, but also higher inherent risks — and different categories of stock mutual funds carry different risks.

For example, the performance of large cap, high growth funds is typically more volatile than, say, stock index funds that seek only to match the returns of a benchmark index like the S&P 500. 

2. Bond mutual funds = lower returns (but lower risk)
Bond mutual funds, as the name suggests, invest in a range of bonds and provide a more stable rate of return than stock funds. As a result, potential average returns are lower.

Bond investors buy government and corporate debt for a set repayment period and interest rate. While no one can predict future stock market returns, bonds are considered a safer investment as governments and companies typically pay back their debt (unless either goes bust).


3. Money market mutual funds = lowest returns, lowest risk
These are fixed income mutual funds that invest in top quality, short term debt. They are considered one of the safest investments you can make. Money market funds are used by investors who want to protect their retirement savings but still earn some interest — potentially between 1% and 5% a year.

## 4. Index funds

### What is an index fund?
An index fund is a group of stocks (or other investments) that aims to mirror the performance of an existing market index, such as the S&P 500 index. An index is made up of companies or securities that represent a part of the financial market. Some large indexes offer a look into the health of the economy as a whole.

An index fund will be made up of the same investments that make up the index it tracks. This way, the performance of the index fund usually closely mirrors that of the index, with no hands-on management necessary.

### Do your research
Once you know what index you want to track, it's time to look at the actual index funds you'll be investing in. When you're investigating an index fund, it's important to consider several factors. Here are some things to keep in mind:

1. Company size and capitalization. Index funds can track small, medium-sized or large companies.  (These funds are also known as small-, mid- or large-cap indexes).

2. Geography. There are funds that focus on stocks that trade on foreign exchanges or a combination of international exchanges.

3. Business sector or industry.  You can explore funds that focus on consumer goods, technology, health-related businesses.

4. Asset type. There are funds that track bonds, commodities and cash.

5. Market opportunities. These funds examine emerging markets or other growing sectors for investment.

Index funds have become one of the most popular ways for Americans to invest because of their ease of use. Their diversity — and returns that typically beat actively managed accounts — don't hurt, either. But passive management doesn't mean you should completely ignore your index fund. Here are some things to think about over time:

Is the index fund doing its job? Your index fund should mirror the performance of the underlying index. To check, look at the index fund’s returns on the mutual fund quote page. It shows the index fund’s returns during several time periods, compared with the performance of the benchmark index. Don’t panic if the returns aren’t identical. Remember, those investment costs, even if minimal, affect results, as do taxes. However, red flags should wave if the fund’s performance lags the index by much more than the expense ratio.

Is the index fund you want too expensive? If the fees start stacking up over time, you may want to reevaluate your index fund.

How do index funds work?
Index funds don’t try to beat the market, or earn higher returns compared to market averages. Instead, these funds try to be the market — by buying stocks of every firm listed on a market index to match the performance of the index as a whole. 

Because of this, index funds are considered a passive management strategy. That means they don't need to actively decide which investments to buy or sell. Index funds are often used to help balance the risk in an investor's portfolio, as market swings tend to be less volatile across an index compared with individual stocks.

### Why invest in index funds?
Despite the fact that fund managers do a lot of work to beat the market (namely, a market index), they very rarely do. And if they do, it's highly unlikely that they will continue to beat the market over the long term.


Actively managed funds often underperform the market, while index funds match it. As a result, passively managed index funds typically bring their investors better returns over the long term. Plus, they cost less, as fees for actively managed investments tend to be higher.

For investors, an index is a group of securities, such as stocks, that are used to measure the health of the broader market. When you hear newscasters talk about the ups and downs of the Dow, they are talking about how well a specific index — the Dow Jones Industrial Average — performed that day.

### Diversifying with index funds
Index funds are available across a variety of asset classes. Investors can buy funds that focus on companies with small, medium or large capital values. Other funds focus on a sector, like technology or energy. These indexes are perhaps less diversified than the broadest market index, but still more so than if you were to buy stock in a handful of companies within a sector.

Individual stocks may rise and fall, but indexes tend to rise over time. With index funds, you won’t get bull returns during a bear market. But you won’t lose cash in a single investment that sinks as the market turns skyward, either. And the S&P 500 has posted an average annual return of nearly 10% since 1928.

## 5. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs)
### ETF meaning
An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a basket of investments like stocks or bonds. ETFs let you invest in many securities all at once. They often have lower fees than other types of funds, and are traded more easily, too.

But as with all financial products, ETFs aren’t a one-size-fits-all solution. Evaluate them on their own merits, including management costs and commission fees (if any), how easily you can buy or sell them, how they fit into your existing portfolio and their investment quality.

### Types of ETFs
Exchange-traded funds may trade like stocks, but under the hood, they more closely resemble mutual funds and index funds, which can vary greatly in terms of their underlying assets and investment goals. Below are a few common types of ETFs. These ETFs aren’t categorized by management type (passive or active) but rather by the types of investments held within the ETF.

#### Stock ETFs 
These comprise stocks and are usually meant for long-term growth. While typically less risky than individual stocks, they often carry slightly more risk than some of the others listed here, such as bond ETFs.

#### Commodity ETFs
Commodities are raw goods that can be bought or sold, such as gold, coffee and crude oil. Commodity ETFs let you bundle these securities into a single investment. With commodity ETFs, it’s especially important to know what’s inside them — do you have ownership in the fund’s physical stockpile of the commodity, or do you own equity in companies that produce, transport and store these goods? Does the ETF contain futures contracts? Is the commodity considered a “collectible” in the eyes of the IRS? These factors can come with serious tax implications and varying risk levels.

#### Exchange-traded notes (ETNs) 
Exchange-traded notes (ETNs) are technically not ETFs but are often confused with them due to their similar names and characteristics. Like ETFs, ETNs trade on exchanges throughout the trading day and track a basket of assets. ETNs often track commodities, bonds, derivatives such as futures, or more exotic assets such as carbon credits rather than stocks. 

An ETN differs from an ETF in that it does not actually own the underlying assets — instead, it's a debt security that tracks the value of its underlying assets indirectly. What that means in practice is that an ETN's value relies on its issuer's creditworthiness — and the risk of an issuer default is worth considering when looking at ETNs. 

#### Bond ETFs 
Unlike individual bonds, bond ETFs don’t have a maturity date, so the most common use for them is to generate regular cash payments to the investor. These payments come from the interest generated by the individual bonds within the fund. Bond ETFs can be an excellent, lower-risk complement to stock ETFs.

#### International ETFs 
Foreign stocks, along with U.S. stocks and bonds, are widely recommended for building a diverse portfolio. International ETFs, which may include investments in individual countries or specific country blocs, are an easy — and typically less risky — way to find these foreign investments.

#### Bitcoin or crypto ETFs
In Jan. 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission approved a handful of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which directly track the price of Bitcoin. This makes the cryptocurrency more accessible to the average investor, as Bitcoin ETFs can be bought and sold directly in brokerage accounts.

ETFs that offer exposure to other cryptocurrencies are still limited. Most crypto ETFs hold futures contracts or the stock of companies that either deal in or invest in the cryptocurrency markets. 

#### Sector ETFs
The U.S. stock market is divided into 11 sectors, and each is made up of companies that operate within that sector. Sector ETFs provide a way to invest in specific companies within those sectors, such as the health care, financial or industrial sectors. These can be especially useful to investors tracking business cycles, as some sectors tend to perform better during expansion periods and others better during contraction periods. Often, sector ETFs can carry higher risk than broad-market ETFs. Sector ETFs can give your portfolio exposure to an industry that intrigues you, such as gold ETFs or marijuana ETFs, with less risk than investing in a single company.

#### Leveraged ETFs 
Leveraged ETFs are exchange-traded funds that track an existing index — but rather than match that index’s returns, they aim to increase them by two or three times. (It's important to note that they don't just amplify that index's gains by two or three times — they also amplify its losses.) 

Imagine you had a traditional ETF that followed the S&P 500. If the S&P 500 went up by 2%, your ETF would likely also increase by about 2% because it holds most of the same companies the index tracks.

If you had a leveraged S&P 500 ETF, that 2% gain could be magnified and instead be a 4% gain. While that’s great if the market is going up, it’s not so great if the market is going down. This is what makes leveraged ETFs riskier than other types of ETFs.

### How much do ETFs cost?
Exchange-traded funds can vary significantly when it comes to cost, with share prices ranging from the single digits to the triple digits. That range may feel intimidating, but it also means there is an ETF for every budget. It may help to outline how much you're willing to spend on an ETF before you dive in.

When researching ETFs, you'll also need to consider the fund's expense ratio, or the fee the fund charges to manage and maintain it. Because most ETFs are passively managed, ETF expense ratios are typically pretty low compared with other types of funds.

#### ETF creation and redemption
Given that ETF shares correspond to shares of a basket of assets, the process of creating or retiring ETF shares is complex — and has to involve a purchase or sale of the underlying assets. 

To create new ETF shares, an authorized participant — typically an institutional investor like a broker — gives the ETF a basket of assets that match the ETF's portfolio or a cash payment. In exchange, they receive a block of new ETF shares with the same value as this creation basket. The authorized participant then sells those new shares to regular investors. 

To retire or redeem ETF shares, this process happens backward. The authorized participant returns a block of ETF shares to the fund and, in exchange, receives a basket of cash, assets, or both that typically mirrors what a creation basket would be for that number of shares. 

#### How to find the right ETFs for your portfolio
It's important to be aware that while costs generally are lower for ETFs, they also can vary widely from fund to fund, depending on the issuer as well as on complexity and demand. Even ETFs tracking the same index have different costs. 

Most ETFs are passively managed investments; they simply track an index. Some investors prefer the hands-on approach of mutual funds, which are run by a professional manager who tries to outperform the market. There are actively managed ETFs that mimic mutual funds, but they come with higher fees. So consider your investing style before buying.

## 6. Options
### What are options? 
Options are contracts that give investors the right to buy or sell a stock or other security at a set price by a certain date. Call options are profitable if the underlying security rises in price, while put options are profitable if it falls. Options are derivatives — their value is derived from an underlying asset.

An options contract isn't an obligation to buy or sell the underlying security. You also have the option to let the contract expire, hence the name. However, when buying options, you’ll pay what’s known as a “premium” up front, which you’ll lose if you let the contract expire.

### How options work
Options contracts exist for a variety of securities, but this article focuses primarily on options for stocks. In that context, there are two main types of options contracts:

#### Call options. A call option gives you the right to buy a company’s stock for a specific price (known as the “strike price”) within a specific time period, referred to as its “expiration.”

#### Put options. A put option gives you the right to sell a company’s stock at an agreed upon strike price before its expiration.

Once you buy the contract, a few things can happen between the time you purchase it and the time of expiration. You can:

Exercise the option, meaning you’ll buy or sell shares of the stock at the strike price.

Sell the contract to another investor.

Let the contract expire and walk away with no further financial obligation.
#### Call options
If you think a stock is going to rise, you can either buy and own the stock outright, or buy call options. But there’s a big difference between these two.

In the example above, notice that it costs $500 to take control of 100 shares of a stock valued at $50 per share. If you were to buy the stock outright with the same $500 investment, you would only be able to take control of 10 shares. This is where the return-magnifying power of options comes into play, and why options are considered a form of leverage.

From the example above, we know that if the stock price rises to $60, it yields a $500 return — you’ve doubled your money. But if it rises to $70, your profit rises to $1,500. If it rises to $80? That’s a 60% increase in the stock’s price that resulted in a return of $2,500. Had you bought the stock outright, that same 60% price increase would give you a return of a comparatively meager $300.

But where there’s the chance for high reward, there’s high risk. If you’d invested $500 in the stock outright, a subtle dip in the price doesn’t mean much. A 10% decline, for example, means you’d be down $50, and you can wait indefinitely for the price to rise again before selling.

Spending $500 on a call options contract, though, means a 10% drop in the stock price could render the contract worthless if the stock price falls below the strike price, and you have a limited amount of time for it to rise again. If it doesn’t, that’s a $500 loss, or 100% of your investment.

#### Put options
When buying put options, the max amount you can lose is similar to call options: If the stock price rises above the strike price, you’d let the contract expire, and you’d lose your whole $500 investment.

However, the magnification of returns we saw in call options goes the other way in put options. If the stock price drops to $30, you would see $1,500 in profit. At $20, profit would be $2,500. But this also means there’s a limit to profit on put options — the stock can’t go any lower than zero. Conversely, when buying a call option, profit potential is theoretically limitless.
